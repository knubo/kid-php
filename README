This is a class for generating Norwegian KID payments and a class for reading transaction log files from Nets.

There are two methods in particular that are of interest:

generateKIDmod10 

	Generates a KID using modulo 10. It is built using two set of numbers
	that will be 0 left padded, and those combined is used when
	calculating the checksum and the final kid.

parseDatFile
	This takes in a string containing the data file with the
	transactions from Nets. It will return an array with
	transactions and header information.

The transaction file and the KID algorithm is described in the document downloaded here (Norwegian):

This minor module is planned to be used by frittregnskap.no
